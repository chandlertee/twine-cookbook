# Twine 2.1.0

Release Date: Jan 31, 2017

## Upgrade Notes

This is a significant update from the 2.0 series. If you're upgrading, please read the notes below before beginning.

If you are upgrading, then making a backup copy of your stories folder is recommended. To do this, launch Twine 2.0 and choose **Show Library** from the Twine menu. Quit Twine, then make a copy of the folder that was revealed. (If you are using Linux and **Show Library** doesn't work, your stories folder is located in `~/Documents/Twine`.

**If you had added custom story formats previously,** you'll need to re-add them after updating to this version. The process works exactly the same as before. Sorry for the inconvenience -- you will only need to do this once.

**If you do not see any stories after upgrading,** double-check your Twine directory by choosing **Show Library** from the Twine menu. Go up one level from here. You may see two directories: one called "Stories," and another named Stories in another language (hopefully your preferred, non-English one). Move the story files from Stories to the folder with the localized name and they should be back once you re-launch Twine.

**If you would like to continue using 2.0.11 online,** it is still available at <https://twinery.org/2.0.11>.
